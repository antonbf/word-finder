# word-finder
Part of a project to determine the "difficulty" of a word in English by its frequency.

All data taken from https://github.com/hackerb9/gwordlist

Set maximum limit to 25,000 words to search, covering 99.93% of English.

The inspiration behind this project was to use it for language learning- ideally I would be able to rate whole sentences or even books and determine what the correct time to learn it would be based on how frequently the word shows up in a specific language.
